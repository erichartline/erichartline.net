One of my goals for 2022 has been to push myself outside of my comfort zone, and one area in particular I am targeting is to improve my public speaking. This is something that I have been actively working on in my current position at [Hireology](https://hireology.com/) by presenting my work during Demos and also being an active participant during bigger meetings. However, I knew that if I really wanted to push myself I would need to do a bigger presentation.

At Hireology, we have a monthly event called Engineering Talks where anyone can present on any given topic, tech-related or otherwise, to the entire engineering team. One thing we have been doing as a team is starting the process of migrating to a more modern tech stack, and from a frontend perspective I have really zeroed in on how we are going to handle writing tests in the future. I have been a strong advocate for [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (RTL), so I decided to do a presentation showing off different scenarios and how we can test them using RTL and another neat library called [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/) (MSW).

I was definitely nervous going into it, but I did rehearse it a few times beforehand (including once to my dear wife who had no idea what I was talking about ðŸ˜‚) so I felt more confident. Overall, I think it went very well! Most of my colleagues had not had experience with RTL (we currently use [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/)) so it was cool to be able to teach them something new.

For the presentation, I opted to use [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck), a library that lets you write presentations in Markdown with the ability to also import and use React components. I also used a tool called [Code Surfer](https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer) that added some awesome visual effects for zooming in on code snippets. I then deployed the app using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which was crazy easy and something I will continue to use for future projects.
